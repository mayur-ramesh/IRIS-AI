# IRIS: Vision in Volatiliyy
CP3405 Team Project

## Project Description
**IRIS** is an AI-driven decision support tool designed to filter market noise. We identify short-term divergences between market sentiment and price movement to flag risk and validate sentiment before a trade is made.

**Key Features:**
* **Sentiment Analysis:** Synthesizing news and social media sentiment.
* **Risk Detection:** Flagging when sentiment and price action diverge.
* **Focus Market:** US Tech Sector (e.g. AAPL, TSLA, and AMD).

## Our Goal

Our vision is **not** to build a "Magic Crystal Ball" that gives Buy/Sell advice.

Instead, our goal is to build a **decision support tool** that helps retail traders manage volatility logically. We aim to act as a "Check Engine Light," alerting users to irrational market behavior so they can pause and reassess their risk.
